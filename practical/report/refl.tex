\section{Reflection}

Lessons learned during this practical assignment is definitely practical, where using many different protocols actually used in IoT to create small smart network of sensors and lights.

Working with the other groups was interesting as none of the groups knew each other which required each group to understand how much the other groups had done of programming and practical work such as this. The end device group had less experience than the cloud group which resulted in a small delay in the development process where the system should actually work as specified. There was one hick-up, that the cloud team expected that the end-device would register one object with both light and sensor information in it. This is not a problem with the broker but just how the cloud reads the information from Leshan. This was the last problem encounterd, during the plug-fest.

All in all the group work went very well and everybody put all their resources into the project. Which was a good experience.
