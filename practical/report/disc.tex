\section{Discussion and results}

Development of this practical project of the course introduced how a IoT solution would be developed from scratch. Starting with only basic code samples and working towards a functional automated lightning settings. The architecture was chosen to favor the knowledge of project participants to be able to finish in time. That comes to show that with any platform and operating systems used, the protocols will keep their structure, as indented. 

To conclude the broker part was launched from a ubuntu laptop that was able to run all required programs. The Mosquitto broker, mDNS service and the Leshan server. The android app is run on an emulator in Windows. Both Mosquitto and mDNS were started from the terminal directly with as detailed debug messages as possible to observe all traffic and clients using them. The Leshan server was as previously mentioned run from eclipse or as a *.jar executable. This completes the system of the broker part and its deliverables defined by the instructions.
