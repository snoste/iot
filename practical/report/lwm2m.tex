\subsection{LWM2M: CoAP and HTTP with Leshan}


LWM2M is the fundamental ingredient in the broker. It provides a REST API for both CoAP and HTTP which can both be modified to serve the needs of the system. Leshan operates with a server/client infrastructure. Thus the broker runs a server module and other devices connecting to it use a client module. The android app and the cloud service take advantage of the HTTP protocol and the end-device uses the CoAP protocol.
