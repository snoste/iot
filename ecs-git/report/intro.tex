%Brief	introduction	of	the	overall	setting
The goal of this project is to design control parameters for motor-mass-spring fourth order SIMO (Singlu Input Multiple Output) system. First of all it is important to understand the physical components of the system and which sensor and actuator are present.

A input signal (current, A) is applied to a motor(object 1) which will turn a spring which is connected to a mass which rotates (object 2). Both objects have encoders and are used to close the loop of the control system, acting as feedback. A few more values are affect the systems like inertia (shape), torque, value of mass, spring characteristic and friction.

This assignment is not only designing control parameters but also interfering with a simulator for the plant. The simulator acts not as a continuous systems but a discrete system with sampling period of 100 $\mu$s. This has to be taken into account during the design in order to. The simulator is a FPGA running xlinux like many high-end FPGAs.
