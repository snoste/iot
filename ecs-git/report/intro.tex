%Brief	introduction	of	the	overall	setting
The goal of this project is to design control parameters for motor-mass-spring system. A input signal (current, A) is applied to a motor(object 1) which will turn a spring which is connected to a mass which rotates (object 2). Both objects have encoders and are used to close the loop of the control system. A few more values are affect the systems like inertia (shape), torque, value of mass, spring characteristic and friction. The system can be described as follows:
