\section{Platform Parameter Design}
\label{sec:platform}

The microkernel slot size C, partition table size P and TDM table size in the control system design play a large role in task timing and scheduling. These parameters' units are shown in Table \ref{tab:design}. The mircokernel slot size will determine the the clock cycles (time) for which the microkernel needs to execute correctly, this was stated to be at least 40.96$\mu$s.

Thus the microkernel slot size could at best reach roughly 40 $\mu$s which would yield to about: $$ C_{min} = 100MHz \cdot 40.96 \mu s = 4096 \;\;Clock \; Cycles$$

This observation was small starting point of educated assumptions about which C and P to chose. Then it was decided rather than to pick values for P and C, pick a fraction, relating those two.
